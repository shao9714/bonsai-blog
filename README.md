# bonsai-blog

Bonsai-blog is a personal practice project using mySQL, Express Node.js, and pug. It is a simple blogging engine that supports creating, deleting, editing, and viewing articles. It has a simple, local based user system that relies on passport.js. To set up locally, run 'npm i' to add the needed dependencies, then create a corresponding database using the database script.

Bonsai-blog is still under construction. It is hosted on heroku @ bonsai-blog.herokuapp.com.
